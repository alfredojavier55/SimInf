##' @param pre_particle An optional function that, if non-NULL, is
##'     applied on the model after the proposal has been set for the
##'     model, but before running the particle filter. The function
##'     must accept one argument of type \code{SimInf_model} with the
##'     current model of the fitting process.  This function can be
##'     useful to update, for example, \code{ldata} of the model
##'     before running a trajectory with proposed parameters.
