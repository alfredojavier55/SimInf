\usage{
pfilter(model, obs_process, data, npart)

\S4method{pfilter}{SimInf_model}(model, obs_process, data, npart)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The \code{SimInf_model} object to simulate data from.}

\item{obs_process}{Specification of the stochastic observation
process. The \code{obs_process} can be specified as a
\code{formula} if the model contains only one node and there
is only one data point for each \code{time} in \code{data}.
The left hand side of the formula must match a column name in
the \code{data} data.frame and the right hand side of the
formula is a character specifying the distribution of the
observation process, for example, \code{Iobs ~ poisson(I)}.
The following distributions are supported: \code{x ~
binomial(size, prob)}, \code{x ~ poisson(rate)} and \code{x ~
uniform(min, max)}. The observation process can also be a
function to evaluate the probability density of the
observations given the simulated states. The first argument
passed to the \code{obs_process} function is the result from a
run of the model and it contains one trajectory with simulated
data for a time-point. The second argument to the
\code{obs_process} function is a \code{data.frame} containing
the rows for the specific time-point that the function is
called for. Note that the function must return the log of the
density.}

\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} holding the time series data.}

\item{npart}{An integer with the number of particles (> 1) to use
at each timestep.}
}
\value{
A \code{SimInf_pfilter} object.
}
\description{
Systematic resampling is performed at each observation.
