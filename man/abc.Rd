abc(model, priors, ngen, npart, fn, ..., verbose = getOption("verbose", FALSE))
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The model to generate data from.}

\item{priors}{The priors for the parameters to fit. Each prior is
specified with a formula notation, for example, \code{beta ~
uniform(0, 1)} to specify that beta is uniformly distributed
between 0 and 1. Use \code{c()} to provide more than one
prior, for example, \code{c(beta ~ uniform(0, 1), gamma ~
normal(10, 1)}. The following distributions are supported:
\code{gamma}, \code{normal} and \code{uniform}.}

\item{ngen}{The number of generations of ABC-SMC to run.}

\item{npart}{An integer specifying the number of particles.}

\item{fn}{A function for calculating the summary statistics for
the simulated trajectory and determine for each particle if it
should be accepted (\code{TRUE}) or rejected (\code{FALSE}).
The first argument in \code{fn} is the simulated model
containing one trajectory.  The second argument to \code{fn}
is an integer with the \code{generation} of the particles.
The function should return a logical vector with one value for
each particle in the simulated model.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to be passed to \code{fn}.}

\item{verbose}{prints diagnostic messages when \code{TRUE}. The
default is to retrieve the global option \code{verbose} and
use \code{FALSE} if it is not set.}

A \code{SimInf_abc} object.

## Let us consider an SIR model in a closed population with N = 100
## individuals of whom one is initially infectious and the rest are
## susceptible. First, generate one realisation (with a specified
## seed) from the model with known parameters \code{beta = 0.16} and
## \code{gamma = 0.077}. Then, use \code{abc} to infer the (known)
## parameters from the simulated data.
model <- SIR(u0 = data.frame(S = 99, I = 1, R = 0),
             tspan = 1:100,
             beta = 0.16,
             gamma = 0.077)

## Run the SIR model and plot the number of infectious.
set.seed(22)
infectious <- trajectory(run(model), "I")$I
plot(infectious, type = "s")

## The distance function to accept or reject a proposal. Each node
## in the simulated trajectory (contained in the 'result' object)
## represents one proposal. The 'generation' argument is the current
## generation of proposals.
acceptFun <- function(result, generation, tol, ptol, ...) {
    ## Determine the tolerance for this generation.
    tol <- tol * (ptol)^(generation - 1)

    ## Extract the time-series of infectious in each node as a
    ## data.frame.
    sim <- trajectory(result, "I")

    ## Split the 'sim' data.frame by node and calculate the sum of the
    ## squared distance at each time-point for each node.
    dist <- tapply(sim$I, sim$node, function(sim_infectious) {
        sum((infectious - sim_infectious)^2)
    })

    ## Return TRUE or FALSE for each node depending on if the distance
    ## is less than the tolerance.
    abc_accept(dist < tol, tol)
}

## Fit the model parameters using ABC-SMC. The priors for the
## paramters are specified in the second argument using a formula
## notation. Here we use a uniform distribtion for each parameter with
## lower bound = 0 and upper bound = 1. Note that we use a low number
## particles here to keep the run-time of the example short.  In
## practice you would want to use many more to ensure better
## approximations.
